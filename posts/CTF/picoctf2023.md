### CTF Overview

picoCTF is a computer security game targeted at middle and high school students. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.

The Competition involves trying to solve a designated number of problems within a specified timeframe. The Competition begins on 14 March 2023 at 12:00pm Eastern Daylight Time (17:00 Monday, West Africa Time WAT) and continues until 28 March 2023 at 3:00pm Eastern Daylight Time (20:00 Monday, West Africa Time WAT) (the "Competition Period").
