cool we have anonymous access to the `Anonymous` share, logged in and saw a file `journal.txt`, downloaded the file into our machine. Checking the content of the file it seems to be a base64 encoded text very large text.

using cyberchef to dcode the file, we downloaded the file back to our machine.

using exiftool to check the file type, we got to see that it is a PNG image file.

cool we got to see the image, let's try steganography to see what we can get from this image.

```

```
using stegpy, we are able to extract the content of the image file. we got a file `_journal.zip` cool let's extract the content.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/CheeryBlossom]
â””â”€$ unzip _journal.zip     
Archive:  _journal.zip
file #1:  bad zipfile offset (local header sig):  0
```
trying to extract the content, got an error saying there's an issue with the header of the file. let's use zip magic bytes to correct the header.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/221475414-fcbdc8f8-99b9-4747-a8bb-59b4b40fdba0.png)

we can see the header is not correct, let's correct it...

now we change it from `FF 4B FF 4B` to `50 4B 03 04`. save and exit.

used `zip2john` to generate the password hash and crack it using `john` and boom we got the password. let's xtract the content of the zip file.

reading through the contents of the cherrytree file,

```
Dear Diary,
   My therapist, Anitta, has asked me to start keeping a diary so that she can get a feel for how I'm feeling. I think it's bullshit, but here we are! I didn't want anyone reading you, so I'm keeping you hidden on the samba share. That should do the trick! My mother called today. Still thinks I should have been a lawyer. Yelled at her and she started crying, so there's another thing to feel guilty about. My girlfriend thinks mum's being too controlling, but she also told me off for being harsh. Talk about mixed signals! I have no idea what to do here. Maybe Anitta will be able to help, but we're not there yet. Anyway, I'd better get going. I have an idea for a big project that could revolutionise computer security! Going to start working on it tomorrow.
   Until next time,
      -J

Dear Diary,
   I spent most of today working on my new password list. These are passwords that no one has ever used before. Almost 10000 of them! I'm going to test it out tomorrow, but I think this could be the future! If we all start choosing passwords from this list, they are guaranteed to be unique, and will therefore be unbreakable. I've added it into my wordlists. Cutest name too: cherry-blossom.
   Yes, Diary. Today I am feeling good. I've done a lot of hard work, and I'm pleased how it's all turned out. Take that mum! I can be successful!
   Until tomorrow,
      -J

Dear Diary,
   Today I showed my girlfriend, Lily my unique password list and asked her to pick one for herself. That's two passwords allocated -- this is catching on! I wonder who to share it with next? I'll take it to see Anitta tomorrow. Mum doesn't deserve the gift -- maybe Harry? Haven't seen him in a while though, so maybe not. Anyway, I'm still feeling good. The demons haven't caught up with me yet! 
   Until tomorrow,
      -J

Dear Diary,
    As you know I spoke to Anitta today. She was very pleased with what I've been writing in you. Apparently three days was enough, but I'm to keep you to remind myself of how it feels to be happy. Who knows, maybe I'll keep writing in you anyway? I've been enjoying our chats! Probably won't be every day though. Things are going really well in my life right now. Lily is wonderful, and I might even try to get along more with my mother. To top it all off, the cherry trees have started to bloom; really early this year. What a beautiful time time to be alive!
    All the best,
       -J

```
reading throught the dairy, we got 2 usernames `lily, and anitta` also there was a password list in the diary, copied it to a file and let's brute force ssh password for these usernames.

checking the version of the os, we can see it is running an outdated version of ubuntu. let's try out kernel exploit.

found an exploit on github. download and comopile the exploit using `make` 

```
johan@cherryblossom:~$ chmod +x exploit 
johan@cherryblossom:~$ ./exploit 
[sudo] password for johan: 
Sorry, try again.
# id 
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1001(johan),1003(devs)
# whoami 
root
# 
```
send the exploit to the target and run it. it gave us a root shell
