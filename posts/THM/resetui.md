we can see the open ports, let's run nmap default scripts scan to know what services are running on these ports

now we know what services are running on these ports

## Enumerating smb

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkðŸ‘½n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/reset]
â””â”€$ smbclient -L HayStack.thm.corp -N

Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

```
checking for null share session, we can see a Data share.

checking the share, we can see some files, we downloaded the files. 

```shell
â””â”€$ cat cjexnwvf.e0i.txt
Subject: Welcome to Reset -Dear <USER>,Welcome aboard! We are thrilled to have you join our team.

checking the content of the txt file, we got a password `ResetMe123!`.

we have write permission to the smb server,

after long research we got how to steal ntlm hash using responder with this ntlm_theft payload. [payload_gen](https://github.com/Greenwolf/ntlm_theft).
