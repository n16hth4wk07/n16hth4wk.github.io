playing around the web, found a blog and in the blog the author `kim` is talking about a depixle tool and there's also a pixlized image with a bluured password. let's download the image into our box. now let's fuzz.

cool we have robots.txt available, let's check what's there.

found an image file location in robots.txt `*/2020/12/you-know-what-this-is-for.png`, let's look for this image file. 

![image](https://github.com/n16hth4wk07/n16hth4wk07.github.io/assets/87468669/681db2c8-3f83-472e-beb0-c3b21206dd67)

after several minutes of brainstorming the location of this image file, found it in `/wp-content/uploads/`dir, as we can see the image file is not displaying. let's download it into our box and try repair or know what type of file it is.

```
downloaded the file and checking the file type we can see it is an ascii text file. let's read the content of the file.

it is a base64 encoding, let's decode and output it to a file.

image: PNG image data, 1499 x 607, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
```
decoded from base64 and piped the output to a file, checking the file type we can see it is a png file.

opening the image file, we can see it has some weird texts, let's research out depiexlizer image.

found a tool on github, check out [here](https://github.com/beurtschipper/Depix). read about this tooll and understand it. noticed that the image file we got earlier is a wordlist to bruteforce the blurred image. let's try it out.

let's crop this image.

crop out the blurred part only
